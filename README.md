**Outer Radiation Belt Forecasting Model**

An outer Radiation Belt forecasting model, predicting if the maximum daily 1.8MeV Electron Flux or daily 1.8MeV Electron Fluence will exceed a threshold set at their respective 60th Percentiles.

VAMPIRE uses a random forest methodology and uses selected inputs from the OMNI dataset, with the flux measurements from Van Allen Probe,

Within the Example Notebooks folder there are 2 python notebooks, one for electron flux and one for electron fluence , both download datasets and pretrained forests from a zenodo repository (https://zenodo.org/records/15130352)
