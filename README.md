# VAMPIRE

**V**an **A**llen **M**ulti-day **P**redictions by **I**mplementing a **R**andom forest for **E**lectrons

An outer Radiation Belt forecasting model, predicting if the maximum daily 1.8MeV Electron Flux or daily 1.8MeV Electron Fluence will exceed a threshold set at their respective 60th Percentiles.

VAMPIRE uses a random forest methodology and uses selected inputs from the OMNI dataset, with the flux measurements from Van Allen Probe,
